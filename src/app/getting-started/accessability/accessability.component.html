	<p>In compliance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> our components strive to be completely accessible to assistive technologies as well as promting best practices for developers.</p>
	<h5>Images</h5>
	<p>Always provide alternative text for images. The <code>alt</code> attribute is not only userful for assistive technologies like screen readers. It is also useful if the user has a slow internet connection and cannot view the image, if there is an error or in the <code>src</code>.</p>
<pre>&#x3C;img src=&#x22;cat.png&#x22; alt=&#x22;A picture of a orange cat sleeping on a brown chair&#x22;&#x3E;</pre>
	<h5>Colors</h5>
	<p>Colors are very important on a website. There are several different sight imparements that a user can have. We need to not only accomdate those who are blind but those who have partial blindness as well as other sight imparements. Check out this demo for examples on how some are affected. Ensure that there is a high contrast between the text and background color. There are several free tools availible that will scan your page and compare text and background colors.</p>
	<h5>Text</h5>
	<p>It is important that text can be scaled up and down without affecting the rest of page content.</p>
	<h5>Links</h5>
	<p>Just like with images it is important to add descriptions such as what the links are or where they go to. If you are linking to a documenet, for example a PDF, be sure to say that in the description. Users want to know what they will be opening ahead of time. Best practie always dictates that you check all your links before your site goes live to make sure they are all working. You would not want a user to click a dead link that goes no where.</p>

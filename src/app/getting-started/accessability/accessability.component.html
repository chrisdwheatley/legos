  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>In compliance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), 2.0</a> our components strive to be completely accessible to assistive technologies as well as promoting best practices for developers.</p>
  <h5>ARIA: Roles, states, and properties</h5>
  <p>Being ARIA compliant for assistive technologies has become the standard. This includes having the correct value for the <code>role</code>, and <code>aria-label</code> attributes alongside the standard element attributes, <code>id</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>value</code>.</p>

  <h5>Images</h5>
  <p>Always provide alternative text for images. The <code>alt</code> attribute is not only used for assistive technologies like screen readers. It is also useful if a user has a slow internet connection and cannot view the image or if there is an error finding the image.</p>
<pre>&#x3C;img src=&#x22;cat.png&#x22; alt=&#x22;A picture of a orange cat sleeping on a brown chair&#x22;&#x3E;</pre>
  <h5>Colors</h5>
  <p>Colors are a very important part of a website. There are several different impairments that a user can have. We as designers need to accommodate those who are blind,  color blind, and or have partial impairments. It is also best practice to ensure the contrast between text and background colors are enough for those with color blindness. There are several free tools available that will scan your page and compare text and background.</p>

  </ul>
  <h5>Links</h5>
  <p>Just like with images it is important to add an <code>alt</code> attribute on anchor elements that link to an outside website or file, describing what it is. If you are linking to a document, for example, a PDF, say that in the description. Users want to know what they will be opening ahead of time. Always check your links before your website goes live and make sure they are working and going where they are supposed to. You wouldn't want a user to click a link that goes nowhere.</p>

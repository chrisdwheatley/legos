<section class="container">
	<h2>Documentation</h2>
	<p>This documentation is sectioned out by component.</p>
	<p>Documentation structure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Description</li>
		<li>Demo</li>
		<li>Code</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each section contains a small explanation of how it's made, a demonstration of the element to play with, and an example code piece showing how it is written. When there are customizations like skins available those will also be shown.</p>
	<p>The demo allows you to play with each component, look under the hood with developer tools and see a working example. Accompanying each demo are code examples highlighting classes or elements that are important to each component.</p>
	<p>Markup Example:</p>
<pre>&#x3C;button type=&#x22;button&#x22; class=&#x22;<mark>btn btn--default</mark>&#x22;&#x3E;...&#x3C;/button&#x3E;</pre>

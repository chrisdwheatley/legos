	<p>The LegoCSS documentation is sectioned out by component. Each component has the below layout.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>description</li>
		<li>demo</li>
		<li>markup</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In each section, there is a small explanation of the component, how it's made, a demo of the element, and some example code showing how to use it. When there are customizations like skins available those will also be shown.</p>
	<p>The demos allow you to play with each component, look under the hood with the developer tools and get to see a working example. Along with the developer tools, example markup is also provided with highlighted classes or elements that are important to each component.</p>
	<p>Be sure to notice when I <mark>highlight</mark> parts of the code. I do this to show you specific classes that pertain to that component.</p>
	<p>Markup Example:</p>
<pre>&#x3C;button class=&#x22;<mark>btn btn--default</mark>&#x22;&#x3E;...&#x3C;/button&#x3E;</pre>

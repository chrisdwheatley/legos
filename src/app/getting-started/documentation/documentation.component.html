	<p>The Lego documentation is straight forward. Each component is in its own section. In that section there is a small element explanation, a demo, and some example code showing how to use it. There are also different options shown when their are customizations like skins availible.</p>
	<p>Anytime i try to call attention to something specific in a code sample I will highlight it for you.</p>
	<p>The layout for this documentation is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>description</li>
		<li>demo</li>
		<li>markup</li>
	</ul>
	<p>By providinng examples it allows you to play with each component, look under the hood with the developer tools and get to know a working example. Along with the devloper tools example markup is provided along with highlighted classes or elements that are important to each component.</p>
	<p>Markup Example:</p>
	<pre>code will
	go inside here</pre>
	<p>Sometimes you will find code inside the explanations in small excerpts. They will look like <code>this</code>. These are just small things that I want to call out to you.</p>

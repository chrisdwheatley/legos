<p>The name is somewhat cheesy and straight forward. I'm a huge fan of Legos, the brocks themselves, and have been a huge fan since i was a kid. While working for a past company the idea of creating small bits of reusable code was brought up and there was really no better name for it, so i stuck with it.</p>
<p>This Lego Library is the coming together of two of my passions. The building of something from pieces and using those reusable pieces to make soemthing larger.</p>

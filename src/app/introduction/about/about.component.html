  <p>There are several reasons I started to make this design system. Each with it's own story:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>To address the complete lack of design communication at a previous job</li>
      <li>A way for me to learn about design systems, their importance, and how they're used while I try to gain more knowledge about UI/UX developer positions (which is what I ultimitely want to do)</li>
      <li>Building the library gave me something solid to learn with different frameworks</li>
      <li>I was starting to freelance and I wanted a core group of components that would make creating websites for clients faster</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Story 1</h5>
  <p>While working for a start up for a couple years as a junior developer I soaked up as much information and experince as possible. This company was attempting to scale very quickly without any dedicated designers, user experience designers, or ux researchers. Project managers were the ones doing each feature design based on what they wanted and what they thought the user understood. This is the first error that i found. Most project managers are so close to a project/feature that they are working on that they don't see it through a customers eyes. They are too close, which is not always their fault, but most of the time their downfall.</p>
  <p>It was not my job as a junior developer to develop or create any type of design flow but as time went on and was given more leeway on my projects I asked questions. Why does this button you want added look different than the ones we already have? Does the user know this button will tigger this instead of that? Why do certain components look that same but do different things as well as the opposite, why do certain components look different but do the same thing?</p>
  <p>Developers were coding from scatch the same components repeatedly with minute differences spanning several products. I wanted there to be a single source of truth for all project managers, developers, and designers. Where they could effectively communicate a set of shared principles and rules which would increase productivity and consistency across all the platforms. By moving to using a design system code would be simplified, less tech debt created, and less time wasted mainting individually made components.</p>

  <h5>Story 2</h5>
  <p>When I started working in that role as a junior developer I became obsessed with the challenge of creating a design system behind the scenes. Slowly I started taking on small components of the websites, starting small with buttons and native html components. With a coworker we were able to strip out majority of all the CSS library styles from Boostrap and Material Design and use our newly created design system one small component at a time. As much as I love being a developer I am facinated and passionate about creating consistent expereinces for users and advocating for how design effects them. Since starting this project my ultimate goal has been to find a way to mold the two positions together into a hybrid type of role where I could be effective in advocating from smart human centered design decisions as well as coding them and updating documenation that will be able to help multiple departments stay on the same page regardless of being in the same office.</p>

  <h5>Story 3</h5>
  <p>I am constantly trying to learn and keep up with the basics of new frameworks just like every other developer. At the time the compnay I was working for was using AngularJS and Angular. I wanted to learn as much as I could as quickly as I could so I decided to not only make the library but to organize and document it using Angular 6. This helped me learn how to set up an Angular project (something I didn't get experience doing at work), routing, what components are, typescript. Mostly all things I never got expereince doing at work I could experiment with.</p>

  <h5>Story 4</h5>
  <p>Along with design systems being useful for startup and companies looking to scale, creating a design system could greatly reduce the amount of time I spend creating basic elements for clients websites. That leaves more time for collaboration and creating unique expereinces for users and clients a like. Have a mimimal source of truth for myself that could be customized for a client website with only a few small additions.</p>

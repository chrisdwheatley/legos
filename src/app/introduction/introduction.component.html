<h1>Introduction</h1>
<section class="container">
	<p>The name is slightly cheesy and obvious. I'm a LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> fan and have been ever since childhood. With reusable pieces of code, I can make larger components just like using LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> bricks to make a castle.</p>
	<h3>What does LegoCSS solve:</h3>
	<p>When first learning programming I used Twitter Bootstrap and Material Design libraries. The CSS libraries made creating a website painless and easy. On the downside, there was a considerable amount of code that came along that would never be used. I would spend countless hours rewriting specific styles to my liking. When I started doing this for every project I noticed how much time I was wasting. That is how this project was born.</p>
	<p>Inspiration for small modular code:</p>

	</ul>
	<p>... plus many many more.</p>
	<p>These guides helped me to understand, appreciate, and customize this library. I encourage anyone with the same interest to make a library. The decisions and processes are truly valuable to the process of learning.</p>

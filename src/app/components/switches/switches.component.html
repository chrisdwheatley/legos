    <p>Switches (toggle), are a UI element that you can use instead of two radio buttons or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between two opposite states. Toggles should only be used when there is a clear (yes or no) or (on or off) decision to be made.</p>
    <p>Example: When I wake up in the morning I turn my light switch on and the lights immediately turn on. I don't need to do anything extra and as effortlessly as they came on I can hit the switch again and turn them back off. There are only two choices, off or on. That is how you should view and make use of switches.</p>
